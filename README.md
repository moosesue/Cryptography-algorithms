# Number Theory and Cryptography Algorithms

This repository organizes various projects focused on fundamental algorithms in number theory and cryptography.

## Projects

- [GCD Algorithm](https://github.com/moosesue/gcd)  
  Standard Greatest Common Divisor algorithm using Python and Rust.

- [Extended GCD Algorithm](https://github.com/moosesue/extended_gcd)  
  Extended Euclidean Algorithm for BÃ©zout coefficients and modular inverses.

- [Modular Inverses](https://github.com/moosesue/modular-inverses)  
  Finding modular inverses using the Extended GCD and implementing in a single character RSA demo.

- [RSA Attacks using CRT](https://github.com/moosesue/RSA-Attacks-using-CRT)  
  Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to attack RSA and to optimise decryption.
