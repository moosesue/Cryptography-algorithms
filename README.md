  Standard Greatest Common Divisor algorithm using Python and Rust.

- [Extended GCD Algorithm](https://github.com/moosesue/extended_gcd)  
  Extended Euclidean Algorithm for BÃ©zout coefficients and modular inverses.

- [Modular Inverses](https://github.com/moosesue/modular-inverses)  
  Finding modular inverses using the Extended GCD and implementing in a single character RSA demo.
